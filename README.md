Currently, DURING a trip, traveller needs to pro-actively check on
* What his/her NEXT LOCATION is
* What the WEATHER conditions are along the route/at the destination
* What the TRAFFIC conditions are along the route
* What good FOOD options are along the route

Our virtual travel companion fixes these key pains by
* Providing notifications to keep users in line with pre-planned itinerary
* Allowing itinerary changes on the go and dynamically adjusting accordingly

We are building a Mobile Web App and a native Android app using NEM as our backend, with Yelp, OpenWeatherMap, OpenStreetMap as our data source APIs.
